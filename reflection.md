Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
Rachel Michaud, Lily Fairman
- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
Wednesday night TA hours
- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
I found Java very difficult to work with, mostly because I have no knowledge of what it can and cannot do, so at every point in trying to code this I had to do a lot of independent research just to figure out what exists and does not, and implementing a lot of methods in Java was a lot more difficult than for python.
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
I feel like the ony conclusion I can draw at this point is that I am not liking it and having a bit of a hard time.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I feel like I spent a lot of time on this assignment and most of it was just trying to fix things that weren't working instead of actually creating code. I think that this would've looked different if I'd had any knowledge or experience with Java before trying to write code for this from scratch, but it did not feel like a positive learning experience for me. I relied a lot on help from cs majors that I know, and I think going to office hours would have helped as well but most of the office hour times do not work with my schedule. I tried to build the basic chatbot code first and add the mirroring aspect after having that, but trying to make the mirroring work was very difficult and didn't end up working.-- I got it to work to resubmit, I'm glad that I got it to work but it was a little frustrating that not knowing I had to use .equals instead of == for strings was the only problem.
